# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

## Requirements

- Use your own code only and start from scratch
- Player can choose the opponent to be human or computer
- Use [L]GPLâ€™ed libraries if necessary; please include copyright notes
- track the time it took you to code the game
- Implement in Javascript so that it works in Mozilla Firefox
- Make use of CSS, provide nice visuals

## Solution

TLDR:

- I choose Typescript as language,
- React as View library,
- MVVM for architecture,
- TDD as development practice (hight code coverage),
- OOP for the model.

### Design

These are the semantic pieces that I used to define the domain model:

- IMatch
- IPlayer1 | ( IPlayer2 | IProgram )
- IBoard
- ICell
- ITurn

#### `class Player implements IPlayer {...}`

Some statements that belong to the player:

- there are only two players at a time
- a player has a unique id
- a player might have a name

#### `class Match implements IMatch, ISubject {...}`

Some statements that belong to the match:

- there could only be one match at the time.
- a match is between two players or between a player and a program.
- a match is responsible for keeping track of the player's tuns
- a match is played until an end condition is met: `PlayerID1WinState` | `PlayerID2WinState` | `DrawState`
- a match has a board
- a match is responsible for deciding if a winning condition has been met based on the board state

The Match class creates an instance of a board, two players, and the turn class.
It is responsible for validating a player move, updating the board, and the turn. It is also accountable for identifying when someone has won and communicating the new state to all the match subscribers.

#### `class Board implements IBoard {...}`

Some statements that belong to the board:

- there is only one board
- a board is composed of 9 cells

The board is a state machine that keeps tracks of different game states. The possible states of the board are: (PLAYING, PLAYER1_WINS, PLAYER2_WINS, DRAW ).

The board is aware of the state of each cell (empty or not).

The board can tell if a given cell is empty.

The board is also able to check if someone has won or tied the match.

#### `class Cell implements ICell {...}`

Some statements that belong to the cell:

- a cell has a unique id
- a could only be in 3 states: `Empty` | `Player1` | `Player2`
- a cell state can only be modified if the cell is `Empty`

#### `class Turn implements ITurn {...}`

Some statements that belong to the turn:

- a turn is responsible for keeping track of which player is currently active
- a turn tracks the number of turns

### TODOs and possible Improvements

TODOS:

- I haven't implemented yet the option to play against a program.

Possible future improvements:

- performance optimization for the React component tree
- end2end testing with Cypress

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install:

- node v15.0.1 => you can do it with volta.sh (an alternative to NVM)
- yarn v2

```shell
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

volta install node@latest
```

To install yarn v2, please refer to the official docs [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:suddenlyGiovanni/coding_challenge--tic_tac_toe.git
cd coding_challenge--tic_tac_toe
```

### Install the dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

## Run the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

## Built With

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [TypeScript] - Typed JavaScript at Any Scale.
- [Yarn v2] - Package Manager
- [Jest] - JavaScript testing framework
- [Wallaby] - A tests runner
